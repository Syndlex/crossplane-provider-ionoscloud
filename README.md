# Crossplane Provider IONOS Cloud

## Overview

This `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` repository is the Crossplane infrastructure provider for IONOS Cloud Services. The provider can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model IONOS Cloud infrastructure and services
* Controllers to provision these resources in IONOS Cloud based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
* Implementations of Crossplane's portable resource abstractions, enabling IONOS Cloud resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
